iVIS innovativt Verksamhetsystem i skolan

It is a VINNOVA-funded project to create basic conditions for the digitization of the Swedish school,
by building a completely open school administrative system.

The project intends to create a school system that makes it possible for the school to develop faster,
in a more innovative way and to move the control over the information from suppliers to the school's stakeholders.
